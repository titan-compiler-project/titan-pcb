# titan-pcb

This PCB is meant to provide an interface between an FPGA and several microcontrollers over SPI, an OLED display interface (or any other I2C capable display) and a power supply for the devices.

It contains the space for:
- Teensy 3.2
- ESP32
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- CH341 USB-to-I2C/SPI chip

Use KiCad 7.0 to open the project.

This board was never manufactured, so I can't guarantee that any part of it will work as expected.
